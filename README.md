# *Time Series - (m12_challenge_01A):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
Credit risk poses a classification problem that’s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

This project is designed to perform the following tasks:
<br>

Use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset.
First, use the original dataset.
Second, resample the data and perform the same tasks as you did in the first step.

### ***Task 1:***<br>
Split the data into training and testing.
<br>
### ***Task 2:***<br>
Create a logistic Regression Model with the original data.
<br>
### ***Task 3:***<br>
Predict Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data.
<br>
### ***Task 4:***<br>
Write a Credit Risk Analysis reourt.
